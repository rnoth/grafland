sysmon

sysmon is a system monitor based on top / htop

sysmon is not really for everyday use, but instead was programmed
to test grafland' hexen.h screen drawing library.

	Controls:

		Up Arrow:	toggle process list up

		Down Arrow:	toggle process list down

		Ctrl-x:		quit

		q		quit



The output should look something like this: 

	   ./sysmon

		 CPU [||                                           ]
