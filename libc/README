About:
------

	This libc is in its fledgling stages, here are some differences
	between it and a fully functional libc:

		* All standard library functions have been renamed by prexifing
		  them
		* Header files have been renamed by prefixing them
		* Printf numerical accuracy is limited. 
		* Relies on the host libc for system calls and system call
		  wrappers.
		* Only about 80 standard C functions implemented.
