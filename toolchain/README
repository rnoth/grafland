Grafland toolchain

BUILDING:
---------
	Build a toolchain:

		make

INSTALLATION:
-------------
	Install a toolchain's libc to a root.

		make install DESTDIR=/full/path/


FEATURES:
---------

	Gcc on target.
		(Cross built as a target package).

	Self bootstrapping.
		(Targets can build themselves.(Experimental))

	Multiple C library vendors are supported:
		(Musl, glibc and uClibc)

	Root filesystems created without special permissions.
		(Host built genext2fs allows the toolchain to bootstrap itself
		 and populate a new disk image without root).

	20 host libraries.
		(ncurses, openssl, libffi and etc)
	
	50 target packages.
		(bash, htop, vim, busybox and etc)
	



EXTERNAL USAGE:
---------------

	Dump the environment needed to use the built toolchain:

		make buildenvars

		Most users will want to export these as environment
		variables:
	
			export `make buildenvars`
	
		The environment can be normalized with the
		clearenvars target:

			export `make clearenvars`


DESCRIPTION:
------------

	The toolchain build system supports multiple C library vendors.
	At this time they are: musl, uClibc and glibc, the effectiveness
	of which in that order. The default libc is musl. To set the
	desired libc override the variable OM_LIBC as follows:

		Build with uClibc:

			make OM_LIBC=uclibc

		Build with musl:

			make OM_LIBC=musl

		Build with glibc:

			make OM_LIBC=gnu

		... or open the single Makefile and set it as desired.

	The default is to cross build for i686, this is modified by setting
	the primary tuple prefix. To do this, open the Makefile and modify
	the following four lines:

	OM_LIBC = musl
	OM_ARCH = i686
	OM_LINUXARCH = x86
	OM_BACKWARDCOMPAT = i386 

	
TARGET PACKAGES:
----------------

	Using the internal package building system:

	The toolchain supports a minimal number of packages internally
	on an experimental basis:

		Target packages:

		1	coreutils_target
		2	vim_target
		3	htop_target
		4	utillinux_target
		5	dhcp_target
		6	strace_target 
		7	dash_target
		8	linux_target
		9	busybox_target
		10	htop_target
		11	dhcp_target
		12	coreutils_target
		13	dropbear_target
		14	strace_target
		15	gcc_target 
		16	ef2sprogs_target
		17	parted_target
		18	grub_target
		19	sstrip_target
		20	links_target
		21	gdb_target
		22	python_target
		23	perl_target
		24	bash_target
		25	bison_target
		26	ocrad_target
		27	xorriso_target
		28	nano_target
		29	groff_target
		30	bc_target
		31	cpio_target
		32	rsync_target
		33	libressl_target
		34	openssl_target
		35	gawk_target
		36	gettext_target
		37	patch_target
		38	irssi_target
		39	wirelesstools_target
		40	libpam_target
		41	mutt_target
		42	inetutils_target
		43	zsh_target
		44	ircii_target
		45	xz_target
		46	gptfdisk_target
		47	pdksh_target


		Host packages:

		1	gdb_host
		2	ncurses_host
		3	ncurses_host
		4	zlib_host
		5	mpc_host
		6	mpfr_host
		7	gmp_host
		8	ef2sprogs_host
		9	pixman_host
		10	libffi_host
		11	libiconv_host
		12	libunistring_host
		13	libtool_host
		14	pcre_host
		15	glib_host
		16	libpam_host
		17	popt_host
		18	netbsdcurses_host
		19	slibtool_host
		20	genext2fs_host


	Example:
		To equip your toolchains with ncurses:
		
			make curses_host 

		To install htop on the target:

			make htop_target


	*_host make targets install a package that the local toolchain
	might need to build a package or library for the installation 
	target.

	*_target make targets install a package or library to the
	installation target.


	Create a bootable distribution with gcc and a number of other
	useful packages:

		make
		make distribute


	Compiler on target:

		make
		make bootstrap



ADDING TARGET PACKAGES:
-----------------------


	Adding a source code package to the package build system:

		A basic method is provided for programmers wishing
		to add new packages to the build system. 
	
			make createtarg pack=mynewpackage

		Then open the Makefile (omnicross has only one) and 
		add something like this to the list of definitions at 
		the top:
		
			OM_NEWPACKAGE=mynewpackage-1.1.1
			OM_NEWPACKAGE_MRR=http://www.some.org

		Though this may seem archaic, the process is simple and fast.
		One can add a basic package, build it and test it in less 
		than three minutes.


		Test it:

			make populate
			make mynewpackage_target

SELF BOOTSTRAP:
---------------

	The toolchain build system provides a mechanism in which targets
	can bootstrap themselves. The new toolchain will be built into
	OM_LIBROOT = which defaults to the "libroot" directory under
	toolchain/libroot. 3 filesystems are created: 1) The system itself,
	2) The source code needed to rebuild the system and 3) A blank
	filesystem onto which the target will rebuild itself. They are
	drive.img, bootsrc.img and output.img respectively.

		make
		make bootstrap

	The target can then be booted in qemu (with all 3 disk images
	attached):

		make test_i386

	On the target machine simply invoke the toolchain build system
	Simply invoke the same commands again. Watch out for linker errors
	and errors with gcc's cc1. It may be a good idea to use a new
	a build path as well:

		make ; make bootstrap

	This functionality is in its fledgling experimental stages and
	has not made it past a 3rd generation build lineage.

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT TARBALLS:
---------------------------

	All tarballs must end in the same suffix. That suffix can be 
	overridden by setting OM_SFX=.
