NAME:
-----
	Ottercross
	

DESCRIPTION:
------------
	 A makefile based cross toolchain and build system.


FEATURES:
--------
	

	Gcc/binutuils on target.
		(Gcc can be installed into the final build's root!)

	Supports all major linux libc vendors.
		(Musl, glibc and uClibc/uClibc-ng.)

	Gpg signature checking.
		(Strong security.)

	Cross compiling is the default build type.
		(As in netbsd, all builds are cross builds.)

	Relocatable toolchains.
		(Toolchains are built using a sysroot.)

	Automatically logged stages.
		(Individuated logged stages are compatible with autobuilders.)

		
USAGE:
------
	Build a toolchain;
		
		make

	Build a toolchain using a different libc (musl is the default).

		make VENDOR=gnu

	Build a toolchain in a target root:

		make gcc_target

	Changing architectures:

		make ARCH=x86_64

	Change the linux kernel architecture:

		make LINUXARCH=arm64

	Change uclibc's arch (has no effect for musl and glibc):

		make UCLIBCTARG=i386

			Note: This is only needed as an adjunctory method
			      for controlling uClibc/uClibc-ng as it has no
			      configure script, it will generally be coupled
			      with LINUXARCH=.


	Put the above options together to create a more difficult to configure
	toolchain (such as i686-pc-linux-uclibc).

		make VENDOR=uclibc ARCH=i686 LINUXARCH=x86

			or 

		make VENDOR=gnu ARCH=aarch64 LINUXARCH=arm64


	Quiet builds:

		make LOGM='>' 




EXTENDED DESCRIPTIONS:
----------------------

	Automatic logging:
	
		Ottecross is equiped with an autologging mechanism which logs
		each stage of the build, names them and gathers them into a logs
		directory.

	Gpg keys:

		Gpg signatures on all packages are checked automatically by 
		ottercross so as to ensure a safe operating environment.
	
		If your system does not have gpg installed or it is installed
		incorrectly  you may want to invoke the build system with
		'make -i' to disable error checking. This will be replaced with
		an option to disable or enable signature checking in the future.


	Concurrent builds:

		Cocurrent builds are possible with ottercross, However, it must
		first be 'dry run" to populate the src directory with any tarballs.
		There is no mechanism to prevent a race between various invocations
		of ottercross populating the main src directory, but will hopegully
		be added soon.
