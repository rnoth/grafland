wget's should be changed to download into the current $(WORK)
directory, check their gpg keys, and then afterwards mv them into

Likewise, extraction should be moved to the first staep of each
stage and only draw from $(SRC).

These changes should allow ottercross to build without multiple
arches concurrently.
