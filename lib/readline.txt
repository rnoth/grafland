Gshline

	An editline()/readline() like function.

	This function is intended to be used with Gsh, 
	(The Graff Shell)

	You may wish to use this function outside of the GrafOS
	build system. In this case make sure that the file hexen.h
	is also present on the build machine.

	This library has a hard dependency on hexen.h, an example
	of how to include it can be seen in readline-driver.c.

	Developers wishing to use gshline() in their code can find 
	a usage example inside of readline-driver.c.



	Up arrow	Scroll history
	Down arrow	Scroll history

	Tab 		Not implemented
	Left arrow	Cursor back one pos
	Right arrow	Cursor forward one pos

	Home		Cursor to start of line



Other functions:

	ircline.h / ircline()
	
	Ircline() is similiar to readline except that the text remains
	on a single line and scrolls from side to side. 

	This function is not very straight forward to use. If you want
	to use it in an irc client you'll have to hack it apart and
	use the various pieces in a asychronous event loop.

	Hopefully this gets fixed some day and the readline()/ircline() 
	functions can share code more harmoniously. This would require
	a wrapper function to be written in which the caller could specify
	a function to run upon the receival of a '\n'. Alternatively this 
	could send an error or negative return value. 

	The builtin line editing key catches are as follows:
		Left arrow      Cursor back one pos
        	Right arrow     Cursor forward one pos 
       		Home            Cursor to start of line

	Add other key catches as needed.
