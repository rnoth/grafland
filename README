Grafland 

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	Grafland is a collection of original software, written by
	myself (Graff) and various contributors.
	
	Navigating to a subdirectory of grafland and inspecting
	the README will reveal more about what that particular 
	project contains.
	

HIER:
-----


	libc/
		Standard C library components.

	
	arbprec/
		Arbitrary precision mathematics using strings.
			-A bignum data type implementation.
		Note:	Developers probably want new_arbprec which is
			being redesigned to support floating point.

	libc/math/
		Transcendental mathematics functions.
			-Operate on and tranform double precision types.
			-sqrt, atan, sin, jn, log and many more such math.h
			 function implementations. This library covers most of
			 the math.h / libm normative cases.

	readline/
		Readline line editing. An editline/readline like implementation.
		This library is used to supply line editing and history to
		the graff shell (Gsh) and grafland irc client. The latter
		is supplied with a unique ircline() function (native).


	curses/ & termcap/
		Hexen, a minimal curses / conio style library. Hexen supplies
		grafland's terminal capabilities and ultimately powers grafland's
		readline/editline/ircline implementation, editor, irc client
		and system monitor.

	editor/
		A native editor. 

	gsh/
		A native shell.

	irc/
		A native irc client and library. 
	
	posix/
		Userland utilities.

		cp, ls, fetch, dd, find and many more, implemented from scratch
		to subsets of POSIX specifications.

	legacy/libsh/
		Userland applications and libraries written in POSIX shell.

	toolchain/
		A cross compiling toolchain and build system. Similiar to
		buildroot but with much simpler code, 
	

BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

	Install a single component of grafland: 
	  
       		cd grafland/posix
		make
		make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSSBUILDING:
--------------- 

	Use grafland's internal gcc based cross compile system
	to build itself or outside software. Links and build 
	specifics are supplied for 50 target packages.  


		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain
	(such as changing architectures or using the tool-
	chain to build other OS)), view the documentation
	within toolchain/README and run the build system
	from toolchain/.


PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. 
	The core functionality (excluding the toolchain) only depends
	on the standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This 
	being the case it should work fine on Linux, mac, NetBSD and 
	FreeBSD.
