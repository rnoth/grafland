Grafland 

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	Grafland is a collection of unique; userland tools, cross
	compiling toolchains, math libraries, arbitrary precision 
	math libraries, terminal rendering libraries, standard C 
	libraries, readline line editing libraries, an irc client, 
	a shell and a cross build system.

	It also contains a window manager, editor, system monitor
	and other useful tools and shell scripts.
	
	Each subdirectory has a README which documents its usage. 
	Navigate to a subdiurectory of grafland to learn more about
	the project it contains.
	

HIER:
-----

	bin/
		Userland applications written in C (native)

		cp, ls, fetch, dd, find and many more, implemented from scratch
		to subsets of POSIX specifications.

	lib/
		Helper functions for the utilities in bin.

	libc/
		Standard C library components.

	
	libc/arb_str_math/
		Arbitrary precision string functions in C.
			-A bignum data type implementations.

	libc/math/
		Transcendental mathematics functions written in C (native).
			-Operate on and tranform double precision types.
			-sqrt, atan, sin, jn, log and many more such math.h
			 function implementations. This library covers most of
			 the math.h / libm normative cases.

	readline/
		Readline line editing. An editline/readline like implementation.
		This library is used to supply line editing and history to
		the graff shell (Gsh) and grafland irc client. The latter
		is supplied with a unique ircline() function (native).

	termcap/
		Hexen, a minimal curses / conio style library. Hexen supplies
		grafland's terminal capabilities and ultimately powers grafland's
		readline/editline/ircline implementation, editor, irc client
		and system monitor.  

	docs/
		Whitepages written specifically for grafland, but which document
		outside software and operating systems. This directory contains
		dozens of unique documents on building micro sized unix systems.

	editor/
		A native editor.

	wm/
		A rewrite of dwm.

	gsh/
		A native shell.

	irc/
		A native irc client and library.

	libsh/
		Userland applications and libraries written in POSIX shell 
		(native).

	toolchain/
		A cross compiling toolchain and build system. Similiar to 
		buildroot but with much simpler code,
			-Link grafland components up into the toolchain
			 for cross compilation and installation.
			-Build and maintain outside software.



BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

	Install a single component of grafland: 
	  
       		cd grafland/cbin
		make
		make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSSBUILDING:
--------------- 

	Because grafland has its own gcc based cross compiling
	toolchain system, it can easily build itself or other
	other outside software. Indeed the toolchain/Makefile
	has links to build nearly 100 target packages. Grafland
	uses these packages internally to test its own toolchain
	effectiveness.

	The cross toolchain build system located inside of
	toolchain/ can be used to create a cross toolchain
	and then cross build the rest of the OS:

		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain
	(such as changing architectures or using the tool-
	chain to build other OS)) you'll want to change
	directories to toolchain/, view the documentation
	within toolchain/README and run the build system
	from there.


PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. 
	The core functionality (excluding the toolchain) depends on only 
	the standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This 
	being the case it should work fine on linux, mac, NetBSD and 
	FreeBSD.
