	Grafland is a collection of unique userland tools and 
	toolchains written natively in C, POSIX sh and makefile.


BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

        Install a single component of grafland: 
          
       		cd grafland/cbin
        	make
        	make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSS BUILDING:
--------------- 
	The cross toolchain build system located inside of
	toolchain/ can be used to create a cross toolchain
	and then cross build the rest of the OS:

		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain
	(such as changing architectures or using the tool-
	chain to build other OS)) you'll want to change
	directories to toolchain/, view the documentation
	within toolchain/README and run the build system
	from there.


	Each subdirectory has a README which documents its usage.

HIER:
-----
	cbin/
		Userland applications written in C (native)
	clib/
		Standard C library components and helper libraries, (native)
		
		Gshline. An editline/readline like implementation. This
		library is used to supply line editing and history to
		the graff shell (Gsh) and grafland irc client. The latter
		is supplied with a unique ircline() funtion (native).

	cmath/
		Transcendental mathematics functions written in C (native).
	docs/
		Whitepages I have written to document various OS and books 
		(native).
	editor/
		A native editor.
	wm/
		A rewrite of dwm.
	Gsh/
		A native shell.
	irc/
		A native irc client and library.
	README
		This README.
	shbin/
		Userland applications and libraries written in POSIX shell 
		(native).
	toolchain/
		The omnicross toolchain (native)
			-Link grafland components up into the toolchain
			 for compilation and installation.
			-Build and maintain outside software.

	ottercross/
		The ottercross PoC toolchain (native)
			-This toolchain has surpassed the quality of the origi-
			 nal omnicross toolchain/ and focuses on security with 
			 gpg checking. It does not yet support the target pack-
			 ages of the omnicross toolchain.



PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. 
	The core functionality (excluding the toolchain) depends on only 
	the standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This 
	being the case it should work fine on linux, mac, NetBSD and 
	FreeBSD.
