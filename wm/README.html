<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>DESCRIPTION:</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	graff-dwm is a rewrite of dwm (which is an extremely fast, small, 
	and dynamic window manager for X) with a focus on clear concise
	programming for the purpose of education (mostly my own).


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>REQUIREMENTS:</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	In order to build graff-dwm you need the Xlib header files.


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>INSTALLATION:</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	graff-dwm is not intended to be installed. Instead simply invoke 
	make and then add an entry for the executable in .xinitrc. The 
	window manager can then be started using `startx';
	
		make 

		echo "exec $(pwd)/graff-dwm" >> ~/.xinitrc 

		startx

	This is suitable as graff-dwm is an experimental fork so there
	is really no reason to be installing it as a primary window
	manager at this time.


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>CHANGING DISPLAY:</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec graff-dwm 


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>CONFIGURATION:</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	The configuration of graff-dwm is done by modifying graff-dwm.c
	and recompiling.


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>Why does this project exist when normal dwm is probably better?</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	I found that despite dwm's concise code and simple user
	interface that its combined 2000 LOC of source 100 LOC
	of Makefile and around 100 LOC of configuration makes
	for a complex read. The effect being that many people look
	at dwm's code, admire the simplicity -- yet walk away not 
	understanding that much about it. This project aims to 
	rectify that and wrap dwm's beauty up into an educational
	resource that is easy to follow along.  


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>Features that have been removed from the original dwm</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	1) Xinerama -- dual monitor support
	2) Checks to ensure no other window managers are running
	3) Version argument -v as argv[1]
	4) User configuration file config.h
	5) Most of the environment variables in the Makefile
	   have been removed.
	6) Some elements of fullscreen support.
	
	Perhaps too many to list..  


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>When will graff-dwm be done?</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

	When there is nothing left to remove.


<br clear="left"/></pre><dl>Notes originally in dwm.c</dl><pre>
</pre><dd><hr/></dd><pre>

 *
 * dynamic window manager is designed like any other X client as well. It is
 * driven through handling X events. In contrast to other X clients, a window
 * manager selects for SubstructureRedirectMask on the root window, to receive
 * events about window (dis-)appearance.  Only one X connection at a time is
 * allowed to select for this event mask.
 *
 * The event handlers of dwm are organized in an array which is accessed
 * whenever a new event has been fetched. This allows event dispatching
 * in O(1) time.
 *
 * Each child of the root window is called a client, except windows which have
 * set the override_redirect flag.  Clients are organized in a linked client
 * list on each monitor, the focus history is remembered through a stack list
 * on each monitor. Each client contains a bit array to indicate the tags of a
 * client.
 *
 * Keys and tagging rules are organized as arrays and defined in config.h.
 *
 * To understand everything else, start reading main().
