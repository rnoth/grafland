	Contents:
	I. Arbitrary precision string calculator
		1. All of these functions go to infinite digits
		2. Functions
			a. add
			b, subtract
			c. multiply 

	II. Transendental functions inplemented using their taylor series
		1. Most of functions work to within 10 digits of precision
		   on either side of the mantissa.
		2. Well ranged algorithms with argument reduction
		3. Varying in performance, slow with arguments nearing '1',

	III. Trancendental functions using continued fraction expansions
		1. Extremely fast.
			a. Functions are completely resolved within 3 iterations

	IIII. Tests for various functions or programs
		1. Tests
			a. testmath.c
			b. teststring.sh
			c. continued_fraction,c

	IIIII. Novelty programs and functions related to math
		1. Programs
			a. multiplication.c
				-> Multiplication implemented as a function of 
				   addition.
				-> Accepts fractional arguments by decomppsing
				   floats using brute force.
				-> Slow.
			b. astronomy_calculator.c


	Description: 
	    All math routines are written in C and can operate without 
	assistance from outside math.h libraries. They accomplish this by 
	inter-relying on each other, for example many other transcendental 
	functions call pow() accomplish thier ends.
	
	    The majority of the functions in this directory are implemented 
	using their respective taylor series.


	Testing: 
	To test the arbitrary precision string calculator, invoke make and then
	run the ./teststrings.sh script which runs the "stringmath" binary 
	against various test values.

		make
		./teststrings.sh

	The continued fraction expansions are all contained within the file 
	continued_fraction.c.
		cc continued_fraction.c -lm
		./continued_fraction

	To test the taylor series based math.h style  functions, build and 
	run "testmath.c".  This program requires 2 arguments. If you are 
	testing a function which only accepts one argument then just provide 
	an irrelevant garbage value for the second argument.
	
		make
		./testmath [arg] [arg]

	
	To use these functions inside a program specify the full path name of
	the function wrapper "math.c":
	
	#include "/path/to/cmath/math.c"
