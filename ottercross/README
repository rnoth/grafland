NAME:
-----
	Ottercross
	

DESCRIPTION:
------------
	 A makefile based cross toolchain and build system.


FEATURES:
--------
	

	Compilers on targets.
		(Gcc can be installed into the final build!)

	Supports 3 linux libc.
		(Musl, glibc and uClibc/uClibc-ng.)

	Gpg signature checking.
		(Stronger security than most small build systems.)

	Cross compiling is the default build type.
		(Like in netbsd, all builds are cross builds.)

	Relocatable toolchains.
		(Toolchains are built using a sysroot.)

	Automatically logged stages.
		(Logs for bug reports are always present and organized.)

	Parallel batch mode.
		(Multiple targets can be built at the same time.)
		
USAGE:
------
	Build a toolchain;
		
		make

	Build a toolchain using a different libc (musl is the default).

		make VENDOR=gnu

	Changing architectures:

		make ARCH=x86_64

	Change the linux kernel architecture:

		make LINUXARCH=arm64

	Change uclibc's arch (has no effect for musl and glibc):

		make UCLIBCTARG=i386

			Note: This is only needed as an adjunctory method
			      for controlling uClibc/uClibc-ng as it has no
			      configure script, it will generally be coupled
			      with LINUXARCH=.


	Put the above options together to create a more difficult to configure
	toolchain (such as i686-pc-linux-uclibc).

		make VENDOR=uclibc ARCH=i686 LINUXARCH=x86

			or 

		make VENDOR=gnu ARCH=aarch64 LINUXARCH=arm64


	Quiet builds:

		make LOGM='>' 




EXTENDED DESCRIPTIONS:
----------------------

	Autologger:
	
		Ottecross is equiped with an autologging mechanism which logs
		each stage of the build, names them and gathers them into a logs
		directory.

	Gpg keys:

		Gpg signatures on all packages are checked automatically by 
		ottercross so as to ensure a safe operating environment.
	
		If your system does not have gpg installed or it is installed
		incorrectly  you may want to invoke the build system with
		'make -i' to disable error checking. This will be replaced with
		an option to disable or enable signature checking in the future.
