each term is rather complex, the numerator refers to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number while the denominator 
refers to factorials
((B(2*n) * (-4)^n * (1 - 4^n)) / (2n)!) * x^(2*n - 1)
the sides just happen to reduce to another sequence

in a format W|A gets :p
there's apparently also a +/- series pi/2 - 1/x + 1/3x^3 - 1/5x^5... for tan
(which only works when x^2>1, but lol)
also sin(2*x)/(cos(2*x)+1) is better than sin(x)/(cos(x))






the arc-functions should only take -1 to 1
the rest should accept -pi to pi


clever manipulation can mean you only need to closely approximate 0 
to pi/2 for some, but still, no relation to 1

the rest should take (-inf,inf)
but supporting that requires argument reduction
arctangent should accept anything right up to infinity





cos(inf) is nan






if you want to use taylor or maclaurin series for trig 
functions each has to be written out seperately. using 
trig identities builds up too much error

you need argument reduction too

if you try to use taylor series for arbitrarily large arguments, (1) 
you'll need exploding numbers of terms to compute a reasonable 
approximation in theory, and (2) due to rounding error accumulations, 
you'll likely never get a good approximation with floating point for 
large arguments
