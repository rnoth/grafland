		The Graff shell implements a small subset of POSIX shell options 
	with the aspiration to add more specification conformant functionalities 
	at a later date.

        Gsh (the Graff shell)

        Lexical structure:

                Redirection operators
                        < > >>
                Control operators
                        | ; & || &&

        Double Quotes:

                Remove the special meaning of whitespace and tokens.  

        Builtins
                exit [NUMBER]

                cd [DEST]:

        Options
                -c
                        Use argument string instead of stdin 
                -t
                        Test the parser with a dry run 


		This shell does not use yacc to create its grammar. For the
	sake of communicating with future developers I have included a 
	description of the tokens and corresponding logic used to create its 
	grammar

		Gsh has its own line editing library located within grafland at
	../readline/gshline.h. For Gsh's line editing capabilities see
	gshline()'s documentation at ../readline/README.


GRAMMAR KEYWORDS/
-

	aredir		is after a redir

	atoken		is after a token

	awhite		is after a whitespace

	aquote		is within a quoted space



GRAMMAR/
-
	This particular grammar should always describe the behaviour of the
	shell as it is coded -- not necessarily the correct grammar. Correct
	grammars should be obtained from the POSIX sh specification then
	worked into the shell and then finally this document.

	';'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'\n' && !'\n'	is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no
			Note: This should perhaps be changed to:
				'\n' && !isspace()

	'\n'		is a token	is not a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	'|'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	"|' '|'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	'&'             is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	'&' '&'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	' ' || '\t'		is not a token	is an ARG next if after token	NUL
		--> has a count pertaining to a COMMAND
		aredir		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
                atoken		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
                awhite	yes	USED HERE FOR LOGIC
		aquote		USED HERE FOR LOGIC

	'alpha'		is not a token	is a COMMAND or FILE		SAVE
		--> has a count of COMMANDS or FILES
		aredir		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
                atoken	no
                awhite	no

	'>'		is a token	a FILE is next 			NUL 
		aredir	yes
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	'>' '>'		is a token	a FILE is next			NUL
		aredir	yes
                atoken	yes
                awhite	no

	'<'		is a token	a FILE is next			NUL
		aredir	yes
                atoken	eys
                awhite	no

	'"'
		aquote	yes						NUL
			




		Quotes essentially disassociate argument based context in 
	language. As they do in the shell. A quoted area no longer uses 
	whitespace to associate a list with a word.

		The boy John of Locklear
			
			vs:
		
		The boy "John of Locklear"

	This quoted verse unquoted grammar defines whether "John of Locklear"
	is a single argument to "The" (which in turn has the whitespace
	delineated argument "boy") or is in itself an argument consisting of
	the surname (surname from person or place).
