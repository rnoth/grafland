grafland system shell

DESCRIPTION:
------------

		The Graff shell implements a small subset of POSIX shell options 
	with the aspiration to add more specification conforming functionalities 
	at a later date.


	(Copyright) 2014-2016, "shell.c", CM Graff

	Gsh (the Graff shell)


LEXICAL STRUCTURE:
------------------

	Redirection operators
		< > >>
	Control operators
		| ; & || &&

QUOTES:
-------

	Remove the special meaning of whitespace and tokens.  


BUILTINS:
---------

		exit [NUMBER]

		cd [DEST]:

	Options
		-c
			Use argument string instead of stdin 
		-t
			Test the parser with a dry run 


		This shell does not use yacc to create its grammar. For the
	sake of communicating with future developers I have included a 
	description of the tokens and corresponding logic used to create its 
	grammar

		Gsh has its own line editing library located within grafland at
	../readline/gshline.h. For Gsh's line editing capabilities see
	gshline()'s documentation at ../readline/README.


GRAMMAR KEYWORDS:
----------------

	aredir		is after a redir

	atoken		is after a token

	awhite		is after a whitespace

	aquote		is within a quoted space



GRAMMAR:
--------

	This particular grammar should always describe the behaviour of the
	shell as it is coded -- not necessarily the correct grammar. Correct
	grammars should be obtained from the POSIX sh specification then
	worked into the shell and then finally this document.

	';'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'\n' && !'\n'	is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no
			Note: This should perhaps be changed to:
				'\n' && !isspace()

	'\n'		is a token	is not a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'|'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	"|' '|'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'&'	     is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'&' '&'		is a token	is a command next		NUL
		aredir	no
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	' ' || '\t'		is not a token	is an ARG next if after token	NUL
		--> has a count pertaining to a COMMAND
		aredir		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
		atoken		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
		awhite	yes	USED HERE FOR LOGIC
		aquote		USED HERE FOR LOGIC

	'alpha'		is not a token	is a COMMAND or FILE		SAVE
		--> has a count of COMMANDS or FILES
		aredir		USED HERE FOR LOGIC
		atoken	no
		awhite	no

	'>'		is a token	a FILE is next 			NUL 
		aredir	yes
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'>' '>'		is a token	a FILE is next			NUL
		aredir	yes
		atoken	yes
		awhite	no

	'<'		is a token	a FILE is next			NUL
		aredir	yes
		atoken	eys
		awhite	no

	'"'
		aquote	yes						NUL
			




		Quotes essentially disassociate argument based context in 
	language. As they do in the shell. A quoted area no longer uses 
	whitespace to associate a list with a word.

		The boy John of Locklear
			
			vs:
		
		The boy "John of Locklear"

	This quoted verse unquoted grammar defines whether "John of Locklear"
	is a single argument to "The" (which in turn has the whitespace
	delineated argument "boy") or is in itself an argument consisting of
	the surname (surname from person or place).
